In this repository, you can find the results of my participation in the hackathon "Forest", participating by the nickname Fattah_Ashurov.

Due to the large size of my initial ipynb. notebook, it can not be uploaded directly to this GitHub repository. This is why you can find access to it via this link [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k4j4QIlfP4f7e16UufmhwtWAnejCF4bX?usp=sharing).
To facilitate the process, I also leave the link to the [Overleaf page](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yqswhjsjknrn#e60d3a) with my report (which can also be found on Moodle).


Warm regards,

Fattah (Abdufattokh ASHUROV)
